          <p>
            Currently, I am working with Dr. Ralph Smith and Dr. Tim Kelley on creating reduced-order models that obey conservation laws. I found that for PDE models based on conservation of an energy-like functional, 
            we can use a discrete version of Green's Identity to derive a finite-difference scheme that conserved the analogous discrete quantity.
             To this end, I considered Summation By Parts (SBP) operators that define finite-difference schemes and associated quadrature rules in such a way that the discrete solution conserves energy.
             Then, I created a reduced-order model using the snapshot Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method and found that it conserves a mass-like quantity but fails to conserve the classical energy for the wave equation. 
            Now, I am working to determine an appropriate modification to the POD method that will allow the reduced-order model to conserve energy.
             In addition, I know that POD-type reduced-order models fail to capture the dynamics of the original system when the data does not lie close to a lower-dimensional <em>linear</em> subspace of the state space. 
            As a result, I plan to use the ideas of manifold learning through convolutional autoencoders in conjunction with conservation law preservation to create fast, accurate reduced-order models that can be used reliably for long-term predictions.
            I also manage the RTG <a href="https://wp.math.ncsu.edu/rna/">website</a>.

            I worked with Dr. Andrea Bertozzi, Dr. Weiqi Chu, and Dr. Wen Li to study phase separation and volume expansion in lithium-ion batteries. 
            Specifically, we wanted to determine how the addition of nanopores in a silicon-based anode would affect the mechanical stress and strains 
            underwent by the battery during the charging-discharging process. While working on this project, I spoke with several experts in math modeling, 
            chemistry, and engineering to better understand the physical context of the problem and develop new methods for analyzing the system. By the end of the project, 
            I was able to create a finite-element solver for fourth-order, nonlinear, time-dependent system of PDEs that was used to model the system on a two-dimensional domain with and 
            without pores and plot hysteresis loops to determine that the addition of nanopores increases the mechanical stability of the batteries over time.

          <h2>Cornell Summer Program for Undergraduate Research (2019)</h2>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2019, I participated in the Cornell Math Summer Program for Undergraduate Research (SPUR), 
            where I worked with Dr. Robert Strichartz and Dr. Kasso Okoudjou to study orthogonal polynomials on fractals. 
            Through the course of this project, I was able to derive recurrence relations for Sobolev Orthogonal Polynomials 
            on the Sierpinski Gasket  and create a comprehensive software package in Python that was used to study the properties 
            of these polynomials and enable fast numerical implementations of the results. During the final weeks of the project, 
            I also studied how we can use these orthogonal polynomials to compute quadrature and interpolation rules on fractals. 
            I presented the SPUR work at several conferences &mdash; including the Young Mathematicians Conference 2019 and Joint 
            Mathematics Meeting 2020 &mdash; and on the SPUR <a href="https://e.math.cornell.edu/sites/op_on_sg/html/">website</a>. 
            Furthermore, I continued to polish and compile the results from the project, and have submitted the paper 
            for publication in the <em>Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications</em>.
