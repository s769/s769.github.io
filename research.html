            I am currently working with my advisor (Dr. Omar Ghattas) and a postdoc (Dr. Milinda Fernando) to study methods
             for the inverse problem for gravitational wave detection. For this project, I have read the current literature
              on general relativity and gravitational waves as well as some aspects of the numerical solution to the governing
               equations. It turns out that the numerical solvers for these equations are extremely computationally expensive,
                taking several days/weeks for each forward solve. Now, I am currently exploring Gaussian Process (GP) 
                surrogate models. We have trained several GPs on a database of numerical relativity solutions. We are 
                using those surrogates in a synthetic Bayesian inverse problem. 
                For this, we are using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method using a Delayed Rejection Adaptive 
                Metropolis sampler. We are finding that the GP surrogate works well inside the training data regime, 
                and we hope to use the uncertainty estimates given by the GP to inform future runs of the numerical 
                relativity code. We can also incorporate the GP uncertainty into the Bayesian inference as model error, 
                which leads to an error covariance matrix that is a function of the parameters. Finally, we are studying 
                coordinate transformations and reduced bases that can help simplify the inverse problem.

            In the summer of 2021, I worked with researchers Dr. Bertrand Rouet-Leduc and Christopher Ren at LANL to study
            Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating synthetic InSAR data to be used in training denoising
            networks. In particular, we considered several GAN architectures including Wasserstein GANs and Cycle GANs. More
            details available upon request.

            At NC State, I worked with Dr. Ralph Smith and Dr. Tim Kelley as part of the NSF RTG on Randomized Numerical 
            Analysis to study reduced-order models that obey conservation laws. In the construction of reduced-order models 
            for dynamical systems, linear projection methods, 
            such as proper orthogonal decompositions, are commonly employed. However, for many dynamical systems, the lower 
            dimensional representation of the state space can most accurately be described by a <i>nonlinear</i> manifold. 
            Previous research has shown that deep learning can provide an efficient method for performing nonlinear dimension 
            reduction, though they are dependent on the availability of training data and are often problem-specific. Here, 
            we utilized randomized training data to create and train convolutional autoencoders 
            to perform nonlinear dimension reduction for the wave and Kuramoto-Shivasinsky equations. 
            Moreover, we presented training methods that are independent of full-order model samples and use the 
            manifold least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projection method to define a reduced-order model for the heat, 
            wave, and Kuramoto-Shivasinsky equations using the same autoencoder.

            I worked with Dr. Andrea Bertozzi, Dr. Weiqi Chu, and Dr. Wen Li to study phase separation and volume expansion in lithium-ion batteries. 
            Specifically, we wanted to determine how the addition of nanopores in a silicon-based anode would affect the mechanical stress and strains 
            underwent by the battery during the charging-discharging process. While working on this project, I spoke with several experts in math modeling, 
            chemistry, and engineering to better understand the physical context of the problem and develop new methods for analyzing the system. By the end of the project, 
            I was able to create a finite-element solver for fourth-order, nonlinear, time-dependent system of PDEs that was used to model the system on a two-dimensional domain with and 
            without pores and plot hysteresis loops to determine that the addition of nanopores increases the mechanical stability of the batteries over time.

            In the summer of 2019, I participated in the Cornell Math Summer Program for Undergraduate Research (SPUR), 
            where I worked with Dr. Robert Strichartz and Dr. Kasso Okoudjou to study orthogonal polynomials on fractals. 
            Through the course of this project, I was able to derive recurrence relations for Sobolev Orthogonal Polynomials 
            on the Sierpinski Gasket  and create a comprehensive software package in Python that was used to study the properties 
            of these polynomials and enable fast numerical implementations of the results. During the final weeks of the project, 
            I also studied how we can use these orthogonal polynomials to compute quadrature and interpolation rules on fractals. 
            I presented the SPUR work at several conferences &mdash; including the Young Mathematicians Conference 2019 and Joint 
            Mathematics Meeting 2020 &mdash; and on the SPUR <a href="https://e.math.cornell.edu/sites/op_on_sg/html/">website</a>. 
            Furthermore, I continued to polish and compile the results from the project, and have submitted the paper 
            for publication in the <em>Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications</em>.
