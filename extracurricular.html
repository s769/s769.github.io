          <h2>North Carolina Science Olympiad</h2>
          <p>
            After graduating high school, I continued my mission of inspiring children to pursue STEM by becoming an ambassador for the North Carolina Science Olympiad (NCSO).
             Here, I organize regional, state, and national tournaments by writing tests, volunteering at events, 
             and working at outreach programs. Throughout middle and high school, Science Olympiad was one of the primary ways that helped me 
             diversify my knowledge of STEM. However, I noticed that while urban counties and school districts 
             boast a plethora of Science Olympia teams and tournaments, very few schools in rural areas are able to support even a 
             single regional tournament each year. As an NCSO ambassador, I have worked with teams and schools 
             in urban areas to help rural areas increase awareness and support for Science Olympiad. 
            <br>
            When I write tests for Science Olympiad tournaments, I make sure that students have to use ideas from multiple scientific 
            disciplines in order to solve the problems. For example, in an event related to anatomy and physiology, 
            I included a question that asked students to come up with a hypothetical plan to mitigate the organ transplant 
            crisis that could incorporate new technologies such as bioprinting. Creative solutions to this problem combined the 
            core biological principles behind organ transplantation with ideas from network theory, computer science, 
            and even economics. Using the platform of Science Olympiad, I have been able to advocate interdisciplinary thinking to young 
            scientists in my community and beyond.

          <p>
            I have been learning Carnatic Music since the age of five. I started learning from Smt. Shyamala Krishna in Kansas 
            and later was under the tutelage of Smt. Geetha Ganesh in Cary, Sri Malladi Suribabu, and Smt. Malladi Vasavi in India. 
            Currently, I am learning from Sri. Madurai R. Sundar in Detroit and have given performances througout the U.S. and India.
